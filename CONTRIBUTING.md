## Adding Areionskey Room items

* Use English for material, object and texture names.
* Use meter for unit of length.
* Your PR should include all source files (e.g. `.png`, `.blend`) of your models (for later editing).
* Your PR must include the glTF binary files (`.glb`) of your models.
* Add a locale key `room.furnitures.YOUR_ITEM` at `/locales/ja-JP.yml`.
* Add a furniture definition at `/src/client/app/common/scripts/room/furnitures.json5`.

If you have no experience on 3D modeling, we suggest to use the free 3DCG software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
You can find information on glTF 2.0 at [glTF 2.0 — Blender Manual]( https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/addons/io_scene_gltf2.html).
